# React 19 useEffect Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `useEffect` hook in React 19 when using an empty dependency array `[]`.  In some scenarios, this might lead to unexpected behavior, such as additional renders or missing updates.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) provides a corrected implementation.
